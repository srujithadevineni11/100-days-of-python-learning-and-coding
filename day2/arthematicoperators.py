# The arithmetic operations are performed by calculator where we can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. This example shows the basic arithmetic operations i.e.

# Addition
# Subtraction
# Multiplication
# Division

n1=int(input("enter a number: "))
n2=int(input("enter a number: "))
add=n1+n2
sub=n1-n2
mul=n1*n2
div=n1/n2
print(f"\n The sum of {n1},{n2} is {add} \n The subtraction of {n1},{n2} is {sub} \n The multiplication of {n1},{n2} is {mul} \n The division of {n1},{n2} is {div} \n")

# output

# enter a number: 1
# enter a number: 2

#  The sum of 1,2 is 3 
#  The subtraction of 1,2 is -1 
#  The multiplication of 1,2 is 2
