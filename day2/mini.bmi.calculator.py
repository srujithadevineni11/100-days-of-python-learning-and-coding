# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI)
# from a user's weight and height.

# The BMI is a measure of someone's
# weight taking into account their height.
# e.g. If a tall person and a short person 
# both weigh the same amount, the short person 
# is usually more overweight.

# The BMI is calculated by dividing 
# a person's weight (in kg) by the square of 
# their height (in m):

# Example Input
# weight = 80
# height = 1.75
# Example Output
# 80 Ã· (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837
# 26

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
bmi=(weight)/(height*height)
print(f"{weight} / ({height} * {height}) = {bmi}")
print(round(bmi))
