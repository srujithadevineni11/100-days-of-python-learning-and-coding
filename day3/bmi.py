# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

# It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

# Under 18.5 they are underweight
# Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# Above 35 they are clinically obese.
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's 
# weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
# Example Input
# weight = 85
# height = 1.75
# Example Output
# 85 Ã· (1.75 x 1.75) = 27.755102040816325
# Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
bmi=round(weight/(height*height))
