# Write a program that works out whether 
# if a given number is an odd or even number.

# Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.

# e.g. 86 is even because 86 Ã· 2 = 43

# 43 does not have any decimal places.
# Therefore the division is clean.

# e.g. 59 is odd because 59 Ã· 2 = 29.5

# 29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. 
# Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5,
# so the division is not clean.

# The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) 
# in Python. It gives you the remainder after a 
# division.

# e.g.

# 6 Ã· 2 = 3 with no remainder.

# therefore: 6 % 2 = 0

# 5 Ã· 2 = 2 x 2 + 1, remainder is 1.

# therefore: 5 % 2 = 1

# 14 Ã· 4 = 3 x 4 + 2, remainder is 2.

# therefore: 14 % 4 = 2

# Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

# Example Input 1
# 43
# Example Output 1
# This is an odd number.

number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
if(number%2==0):
    print("This is an even number")
else:
    print("This is an odd number")
