# Write a program that works out whether 
# if a given year is a leap year.
# A normal year has 365 days,
# leap years have 366, with an extra day in February.
# The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating, 
# this video does it more justice:

# This is how you work out whether 
# if a particular year is a leap year.

# on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 

# **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 

# **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

# e.g. The year 2000:

# 2000 Ã· 4 = 500 (Leap)

# 2000 Ã· 100 = 20 (Not Leap)

# 2000 Ã· 400 = 5 (Leap!)

# So the year 2000 is a leap year.

# But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:

# 2100 Ã· 4 = 525 (Leap)

# 2100 Ã· 100 = 21 (Not Leap)

# 2100 Ã· 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)

# Example Input 1
# 2400
# Example Output 1
# Leap year.
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
if(year%4==0 and year%100!=0 or year%400==0):
    print("Leap year.")
else:
    print("Not leap year.")
