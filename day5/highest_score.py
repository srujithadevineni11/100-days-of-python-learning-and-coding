# You are going to write a program that 
# calculates the highest score from a List
# of scores.

# e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

# Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. 
# The output words must match the example. i.e

# The highest score in the class is: x

# Example Input
# 78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89
# In this case, student_scores would be a list that looks like:
# [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

# Example Output
# The highest score in the class is: 91
# e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:


# Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
  student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
print(student_scores)
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡
great=0
for i in student_scores:
    if(i>great):
        great=i
print("The highest score in the class is:",great)
